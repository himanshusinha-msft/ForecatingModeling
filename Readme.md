## Problem 

We are in the business of  helping external customer and it frequently   happens that due to new feature roll outs , outages, a user(s) is working a integration  etc , question on the  community forum increases and we run into capacity issues on our side .

### Solution 
The intend here was to create a forecasting model for our ticketing data , with an confidence that this help us predict the future tickets . This prediction will help us plan capacity issues . Also it will also show as "lean" period which will help us better plan our resources .  We do have the historical data for the last three years . The way our data was we had daily data for each day. 

We are using the 
* Spark on Azure datarbicks 
* Pandas 
* Prophet package for forecasting
